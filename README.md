krakenplay
==========

*Project just started - everything is work in progress ;-)*

Motivation
========

Ever tried to connect more than 4 XBox controller? Or more than one keyboard? Or n mouses?
Most likely not. Even if enough ports are available, OSes usally supports only a limited number of devices.

Here comes the solution: Connect input devices from other computers via network!

Krakenplay is a framework on the base of OIS that allows you to connect an arbitrary number of input devices via network. Clients for Unix/Mac/Windows will feed data to an platform independent API which you can easily integrate into your application

Usage
========
*TODO*
